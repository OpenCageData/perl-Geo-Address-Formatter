       - no code changes
       - we now have at least one test for each of the 249 territories of the world!
       - From the coverage script in the address-formatting repo:
       We are aware of 249 territories 
       We have tests for 249 (100%) territories
       We have rules for 249 (100%) territories
       0 (0%) territories have neither rules nor tests

       - no code changes
       - set min perl version to 5.12 to avoid cpantesters warnings for
         perls that don't support 'feature "unicode_strings";'
       - use github issue tracker not RT
       - From the coverage script in the address-formatting repo:
       We are aware of 249 territories 
       We have tests for 243 (97%) territories
       We have rules for 249 (100%) territories
       0 (0%) territories have neither rules nor tests

        - require Text::Trim to stop some CPAN testers failures, no further 
          code changes

1.52    2016-02-16
        - output (and tests in the address-formatting submodule repository) 
          is now multilinerather than comma seperated. Many countries 
          have formats where commas are significant.
          Clearly we should have done it that way from the start. Apologies.

          We are aware of 249 territories 
          We have tests for 177 territories
