1.57   2016-06-16
       - deal with postcode ranges like '68100;68200' which it seems are not
         uncommon in OSM

1.56   2016-05-10
       - no code changes
       - we now have at least one test for each of the 249 territories of the world!
       - From the coverage script in the address-formatting repo:
       We are aware of 249 territories 
       We have tests for 249 (100%) territories
       We have rules for 249 (100%) territories
       0 (0%) territories have neither rules nor tests

1.55   2016-05-02
       - no code changes
       - set min perl version to 5.12 to avoid cpantesters warnings for
         perls that don't support 'feature "unicode_strings";'
       - use github issue tracker not RT
       - From the coverage script in the address-formatting repo:
       We are aware of 249 territories 
       We have tests for 243 (97%) territories
       We have rules for 249 (100%) territories
       0 (0%) territories have neither rules nor tests

          parser otherwise reads a postcode of 00123 as 123.

1.53    2016-03-22
        - require Text::Trim to stop some CPAN testers failures, no further 
          code changes
        - From the coverage script in the address-formatting repo:
        We are aware of 249 territories

        We have rules for 249 (100%) territories
        0 (0%) territories have neither rules nor tests
        

1.52    2016-02-16
        - output (and tests in the address-formatting submodule repository) 
          is now multilinerather than comma seperated. Many countries 
          have formats where commas are significant.
          Clearly we should have done it that way from the start. Apologies.
        - From the coverage script in the address-formatting repo:
          We are aware of 249 territories 
          We have tests for 177 territories
